Challenges:
1, it is a huge program, decide the system struture is hard.
2, use ping, cache, geo location for choosing better replica
3, use LFU, dict and deque to restore page
4, limit the whole dir less than 10M
5, Use the class inheritance with parent BaseRequestHandler, UDPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
6, realize the packet structure of DNS
